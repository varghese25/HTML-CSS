## HTML Links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:<br>
Example<br>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a><br>

## HTML Images<br>
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:<br>
Example<br>
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"><br>

## How to View HTML Source<br>
Click CTRL + U in an HTML page, or right-click on the page and select "View Page Source". This will open a new tab containing the HTML source code of the page.<br>

## Inspect an HTML Element:
Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose "Inspect" to see what elements are made up of (you will see both the HTML and the CSS). You can also edit the HTML or CSS on-the-fly in the Elements or Styles panel that opens.<br>


## HTML Elements
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.<br>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:.<br>
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>.<br>



Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!<br>



## Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.<br>
The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>):<br>
Example<br>
<!DOCTYPE html><br>
<html><br>
<body><br>

<h1>My First Heading</h1><br>
<p>My first paragraph.</p><br>

</body><br>
</html><br>

## HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.<br>



## HTML Attributes<br>
1. All HTML elements can have attributes<br>
2. Attributes provide additional information about elements<br>
3. Attributes are always specified in the start tag<br>
4. Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"<br>

## The href Attribute<br>
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:<br>
Example<br>
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a><br>


## The src Attribute<br>
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:<br>

Example<br>
<img src="img_girl.jpg"><br>
